Description: zywj is a smart logistics knowledge graph service platform. You can use its original resources and visit the website to enjoy its services.

## Introduction：

In this project, we have designed a smart logistics knowledge graph service platform, zywj, aimed at providing users with functions such as recommendation and recruitment

Our project mainly includes four aspects: data layer, extraction layer, knowledge layer, and application layer. The data layer mainly obtains post release data and news data. The extraction layer uses deep learning technology for data analysis, extraction, and mining. The knowledge layer transforms a large amount of text data into reliable structured knowledge, forming a knowledge graph. Finally, the application layer displays it through web pages.During this process, we adopted some algorithms and achieved good results.

## Use-Cases:

zywj mainly includes functions such as news recommendation, job recommendation, and intelligent job recommendation. Below we list the main use cases of zywj to achieve effective management.

- **Position intelligent recommendation**: zywj can achieve intelligent job recommendation. Users can enter their job requirements in the search box and recommend corresponding positions according to the requirements
- **Association Discovery**: zywj can recommend some similar documents for managers, which is helpful for them to further analyze the reliability and substation of other news and public sentiments.
